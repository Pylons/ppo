          <p>
            The Pylons Project is composed of a disparate group of project leaders with experience going back to the very start of Python web frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collectively, we have experience and humility gained by making (and surviving) every stupid decision that could be imagined. We aim to bring fresh ideas to classic web development problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than focusing on a single web framework, the Pylons Project develops a collection of related technologies. The first package from the Pylons Project was the <a href="https://trypyramid.com/">Pyramid web framework</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other packages have been added to the collection over time, including higher-level components and applications. The project has become an ecosystem of well-tested, well-documented components which interoperate easily.

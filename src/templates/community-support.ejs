              <p>To report <strong>security issues with projects under the Pylons Project</strong>, including Pyramid, send email to: <a href="mailto:pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com">pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com</a>. If we determine that your report may be a security issue within the project's source code, we may contact you for further information.</p>

              <h3>General Support</h3>
              <p>For help with Pylons Project projects, including requests for help with your code, you may post to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pylons-discuss">pylons-discuss mail list</a>.</p>
              <p>Pylons Project developers are also generally available on the <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pyramid">#pyramid</a> channel on the Freenode IRC Network.</p>
                <p>Do not post requests for general support to the project's GitHub issue tracker. GitHub is intended to report issues and bugs with the project, not your code.</p>

              <h3>Using Support Wisely</h3>
              <p>Before asking a technical question on a mail list or in IRC, please make sure to try the following things (paraphrased from <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#before">Before You Ask</a>):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Try to find an answer by reading the manual.</li>
                <li>Try to find an answer by searching the mail list archives.</li>
                <li>Try to find an answer by searching the Web.</li>
                <li>Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.</li>
                <li>If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>After exhausing these avenues, it's completely appropriate to ask a question on the pylons-discuss mail list or #pyramid and #pylons IRC channels. When you ask your question, please describe what you've learned from the efforts above, as it will help the developers focus on answering your question quickly. It also helps tremendously if you are able to provide a code or configuration snippet that makes the problem easily repeatable.</p>

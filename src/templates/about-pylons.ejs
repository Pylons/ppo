		<h1 class="title text-blue">About The Pylons Project</h1>
		<p>The Pylons Project is composed of a disparate group of project leaders
		with experience going back to the very start of Python web frameworks.
		Collectively, we have experience and humility gained by making (and
		surviving) every stupid decision that could be imagined.  We aim to bring
		fresh ideas to classic web development problems.</p>
		<p>Rather than focusing on a single web framework, the Pylons Project will
		develop a collection of related technologies.  The first package from the
		Pylons Project was the Pyramid web framework. Other packages have been added
		to the collection over time, including higher-level components and
		applications.  We hope to evolve the project into an ecosystem of
		well-tested, well-documented components which interoperate easily.</p>
